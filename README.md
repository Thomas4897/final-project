# Final Project

## Chess Game

This project is an interactive web application that allows users to play the game chess. A chessboard and pieces are generated, set up, and displayed to the users. There are two timers (one on either side) that display the time each player has to make their moves. When a piece is selected the user will then need to select a location to move that piece. If the location is occupied by the opponent's side they will be able to capture that piece.
